# Super-chatbot-game

## Description

This is some form of game centered around large language models, in this game the aim is to trick the AI 
into giving you the password. I am _bad_ at writing Rust so it was a great idea to write this in Rust 
while the clock was ticking. Gotta do some [shoutouts](#Shoutouts). 

## Start application

For ease-of-use I have created .env.example which you can copy or just source directly.
This file contains aliases for running the application.

To run the styles:
```bash
$ style-start
```

To run the server:
```bash
$ chat-start
```

## Shoutouts

Code to the Moon, whose repo I could... *take inspiration* from when I realized 
I was in way over my head [repo](https://github.com/MoonKraken/rusty_llama/tree/main).

Lakera, this game is basically just a ~~shit~~ cheap version of their [game](https://gandalf.lakera.ai/).
